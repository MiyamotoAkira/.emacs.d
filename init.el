;;; package --- Summary
;;; Commentary:
;;; This is my configuration of Emacs.

;;; Code:

;; The whole let doesn't seem to be needed anymore?
;; Normally file-name-handler-alist is set to

;; (("\\`/[^/]*\\'" . tramp-completion-file-name-handler)
;;  ("\\`/[^/|:][^/|]*:" . tramp-file-name-handler)
;;  ("\\`/:" . file-name-non-special))

;; Which means on every .el and .elc file loaded during start up, it has to runs those regexps against the filename.
;; (let ((file-name-handler-alist nil)))

;; we want custom setup on a separate file. This is set because all the variables
;; that appear there are set on the different .el setup files I have


(setq custom-file (expand-file-name "custom.el" user-emacs-directory))

;; This is to move setup into an org file
(require 'org)
